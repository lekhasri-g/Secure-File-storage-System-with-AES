üîí SFS ‚Äì Secure File Storage

Overview

SFS (Secure File Storage) is a Python-based tool designed to encrypt and decrypt files securely using either a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It allows users to store sensitive data safely by encrypting individual or multiple files into a vault, using either a password or a keyfile for protection.


---

üß© GUI Mode

Launching the GUI

# Navigate to your project directory
cd sfs_project

# Run the GUI version of the Secure File Storage tool
python sfs_gui.py

Description

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) offers an intuitive and user-friendly layout for encryption and decryption.
Users can:

Select one or more files for encryption or decryption.

Load or generate a keyfile.

Set an output directory for encrypted or decrypted files.

Combine multiple files into a single encrypted vault.


Example Output:
The GUI window displays options such as:

> Choose File(s) ‚Üí Load/Generate Keyfile ‚Üí Encrypt / Decrypt

‚öôÔ∏è CLI Mode ‚Äì Encryption & Decryption

Encrypting a File

python sfs_cli.py encrypt --in-file myfile.txt --password MyStrongPass --out myfile.txt.enc

Description:
This command encrypts the file myfile.txt with the password MyStrongPass.
A new encrypted file named myfile.txt.enc will be created in the same directory.
Successful encryption is confirmed with:

> Encrypted: myfile.txt.enc




---

Advanced CLI Example (With Input & Output Directories)

# Encrypt a file and save it to an output directory
python sfs_cli.py encrypt --in-file myfile.txt --password MyStrongPass --out-dir encrypted_files/

# Decrypt the same file
python sfs_cli.py decrypt --in-file encrypted_files/myfile.txt.enc --password MyStrongPass --out-dir decrypted_files/

Description:
This advanced example shows how to specify input and output paths while encrypting and decrypting files.
It confirms successful decryption and verifies file integrity with:

> Integrity OK: True


## Features
- AES-256 encryption and decryption
- Metadata storage (filename, timestamp, SHA-256 hash)
- File integrity verification

## Usage
### CLI
Encrypt a file:
```bash
python sfs_cli.py encrypt --input file.txt --password mypass
```

Decrypt a file:
```bash
python sfs_cli.py decrypt --input file.txt.enc --password mypass
```

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

üöÄ Quick Next Steps After Downloading

1Ô∏è‚É£ Unzip the Project

unzip sfs_project.zip -d sfs_project
cd sfs_project


---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Try the CLI (Recommended First)

üîë Generate a Keyfile

python3 sfs_cli.py gen-key -o mykey.key

üîê Encrypt (with Interactive Password)

python3 sfs_cli.py encrypt --password-prompt -i sample.txt -o sample.txt.enc

üîì Decrypt a File

python3 sfs_cli.py decrypt --password-prompt --in-file sample.txt.enc --out-dir ./decrypted


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the GUI (If PyQt5 Is Installed)

python3 sfs_gui.py

The GUI supports:

Creating keyfiles

Encrypting single files or vaults

Decrypting files with password or keyfile



---

üß© Additional CLI Examples

Generate Keyfile

python3 sfs_cli.py gen-key -o mykey.key

Encrypt File with Password (Prompted)

python3 sfs_cli.py encrypt --password-prompt -i sample.pdf -o sample.pdf.enc

Encrypt with Keyfile

python3 sfs_cli.py encrypt --keyfile mykey.key -i sample.pdf -o sample.pdf.enc

Create a Vault of Multiple Files

python3 sfs_cli.py encrypt --vault --password-prompt --in-files file1.txt file2.jpg -o myvault.enc

Decrypt a File

python3 sfs_cli.py decrypt --password-prompt --in-file sample.pdf.enc --out-dir ./decrypted

Extract a Vault

python3 sfs_cli.py decrypt --vault --password-prompt --in-file myvault.enc --out-dir ./extracted


---

üß† Security Notes

AES-GCM provides confidentiality and authentication ‚Äî if verification fails, decryption will raise an error.

PBKDF2 iterations are set high for strong password derivation (you can increase them for added security).

‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT pass passwords on the CLI in production ‚Äî always use the password prompt or a keyfile for safety.



---



---

üí° Notes

The CLI is lightweight and ideal for scripting or automation.

The GUI is user-friendly and best for manual file management.

Encrypted files use a .enc extension.

You can use either password-based or keyfile-based encryption.



---

üß† Example Use Case

You can use SFS to securely store:

Sensitive project files

Password lists

Personal or confidential documents



---

üõ† Requirements

Python 3.x

PyQt5 or Tkinter (for GUI)

cryptography library


Install dependencies:

pip install cryptography
